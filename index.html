        My name is Dani White, and I'm an MEng student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT.
        I will graduate in May of 2022 and I'm currently looking for a full time
        position related to controls/robotics after graduation.
    </p>
    <p>
        I work in the <a href="https://lis.csail.mit.edu/">Learning and Intelligent Systems Group</a>
        under Professor <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/">Tomás Lozano-Pérez</a>.
        My research focuses on nonprehensile manipulation of paper, which you read more about
        <a href="https://daniwhite.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/06/01/research.html">here</a>.

        Before starting my MEng, I completed my undergraduate degree in Course 6-2 (Electrical
        Engineering and Computer Science) at MIT and graduated in February 2021.
        I've interned at
        <a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla</a> as a Vehicle Software Integration intern,
        <a href="https://www.asml.com/en">ASML</a> as a Mechatronics intern,
        <a href="https://www.zenuity.com/">Zenuity</a> as a Decision and Control intern,
        and <a href="https://tulip.co">Tulip Interfaces</a> as a Hardware and Embedded intern.
        A lot of the projects below are from my work on <a href="https://fsae.mit.edu/">MIT
        Motorsports</a>, which is a student team that builds an electric racecar to compete in the
        FSAE Electric competition.
