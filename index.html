        My name is Dani White, and I'm a senior in 6-2 (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)
        at MIT.
        I'm interested in robotics, embedded systems, and control.
        I'm planning on pursing my MEng at MIT after I graduate at the end of the fall.
        I've interned at <a href="https://www.asml.com/en">ASML</a> as a Mechatronics intern,
        <a href="https://www.zenuity.com/">Zenuity</a> as a Decision and Control intern,
        and <a href="https://tulip.co">Tulip Interfaces</a> as a Hardware and Embedded intern.
        A lot of the project below are from my work on <a href="https://fsae.mit.edu/">MIT
            Motorsports</a>, which is a student team that builds an electric racecar to compete in the
        FSAE Electric competition.
