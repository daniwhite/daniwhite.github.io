description: "As part of <a href='http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/Spring2020/'>6.832 Underactated Robotics</a>, taught by Russ Tedrake at MIT, I implemented a steady state controller for a torque vectoring vehicle in simulation as my final project."

In spring of 2020, I took <a href='http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/Spring2020/'>6.832 Underactated Robotics</a> at MIT. For the final project, I implemented a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller for steady-state control for the FSAE Skidpad event in Drake. I made the following video as my final presentation for the class:
